        <h3>Roughly Translated to Happy Soda</h3>
        <p>As the title suggests, <em>gembira</em> is an Indonesian word for "happy".
           The combination of soda water, sweet condensed milk, and coco pandan syrup
           makes the drink milky and sweet, hence popular among children. The term <em>gembira</em>
           often comes from the happy reaction of children after drinking this sweet treat, hence
           the name. Now let's try it yourself and be <em>gembira</em> too!
